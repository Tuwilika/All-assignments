##Hello Octocat
I love OCtocat. SHe's the coolest cat in town.

```{r quick_look, echo=TRUE}
data(anscombe)
dim("anscombe")
names(anscombe)
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
summary(anscombe)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r xy_PLOT, ECHO=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', fig.path='./figures/', fig.ext='svg'}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
data("anscombe")
plot(x=anscombe$x1, y=anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}

path <- file.path('~', 'Assignment 4', 'analgesic.csv')
df <- data.frame('analgesic.csv')
df <- read.csv('analgesic.csv')
```

```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
dim(df)
names(df)
head(df, n=6)
tail(df, n=6)
summary(df)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}

df_1 <- gather(df, key = Measures, value = Value, Measurement_1, Measurement_2, Measurement_3, -ID)
df_2 <- group_by(df_1, ID, Group)
summarise(df_2, mean = mean(Value))

```

# Chicken weights
## Null Hypothesis
* the chick weights are not dependent on the feed

## ALternative Hypothesis
* the chick weights are dependent on the feed
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Read chick-weights.csv
x <- read.csv("chick-weights.csv")

# Tidy chick-weights data using boxplot
boxplot(x$weight ~ x$feed)

# State null and alternative hypotheses
"H0 : the chick weights are dependent on the feed" 
"H1 : the chick weights are not dependent on the feed"

# State and run statistical test
chickanova <- aov(weight~feed, data = x)
summary(chickanova)

# Comparing means of three or more groups

# State degree of freedom and p-value
Df = 5
'p-value <0.05'
"Reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis"

```
# The Hot Zone
## Null hypothesis
* water contamination does not cause gastroenteritis

## Alternative hypothesis
* water contamination does cause gastroenteritis
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Read gastroenteritis data
x <- read.csv("gastroenteritis.csv")

# Tidy gastroenteritis data using scatter plot
y <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data=x)
y

#Plot barplot
barplot(y, beside = TRUE, ylab = 'water consumption', xlab = 'clinical outcome', main = 'Gastroenteritis', col = c('pink', 'turquoise', 'grey'))
legend ('top', c('< 1 glasses/day', '> 4 glasses/day', '1 to 4 glasses/day'), fill = c('pink', 'turquoise', 'grey'))

# Statistical test
z <- chisq.test(y, correct = TRUE)
z
```
## Test assumptions
* determining whether there is an association between 2 variables
* analysing 2 catagorical variables

## Outcome Interpretation
* df = 2 
* p-value <0.05, therefore, reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
# Nausea
## Null hypothesis
* Receiving emetogenic chemotherapy does not cause nausea

## Alternative hypothesis
* Receiving emetogenic chemotherapy does cause nausea
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Read Nausea data
x <- read.csv("nausea.csv")

#Plotting data
plot(x$Nausea_before ~ x$Patient, type = "l", ylim = c(0,6), xlab = 'Patient', ylab = 'Nausea_intensity', main = 'Nausea intensity decreases with treatment', col= 'purple')
lines(x$Nausea_after)
legend ('top', c('Nausea_before', 'Nausea_after'), fill = c('purple', 'black'))

# Statistical test
wilcox.test(x$Nausea_before, x$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)

```
## Test assumptions
* Data is paired, and non-parametric
* Two pairs of measurements taken on same experimental group

## Outcome interpretation
* Df = 7
* p-value <0.05, therefore reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis

#Housing Prices
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Import dataset
goo <- read.csv("housing-prices.csv")
goo

interest = goo$interest_rate
house_price = goo$median_house_price_USD
head(cbind(interest, house_price))

plot(interest, house_price, xlab = "interest_rate", ylab = "median_house_price_USD", pch = 19, col = 'grey', main = 'Interest Rate decreases Housing Price')
abline(lm(goo$median_house_price_USD ~ goo$interest_rate,data = goo), col= 'pink', lwd = 2)

# Linear regression
 goo1 <- lm(goo$median_house_price_USD ~ goo$interest_rate, data = goo)
 summary(goo1)
 
 # Diagnostic plot 1
 plot(x = goo1$fitted.values, y = goo1$residuals, main = 'Homoskedasticity', pch = 19, col = 'grey')
 abline(h = 0, col = 'pink', lwd = 3)
 
 # Diagbnostic plot 2: gaussian residual distribution
 qqnorm(goo1$residuals)
 qqline(goo1$residuals)
 
 # Binary outcome variabe
 glm( goo$median_house_price_USD ~ goo$interest_rate, data = goo)
```
## Null hypothesis: the housing price is not dependent on the interest rate
## Alternative hypothesis: the housing price is dependent on the interest rate

## Analysis Assumption:
* Ran scatter plot to see trend 
* Diagnostics for linear regression; QQ-plot to determine whether the residuals are normally distributed and the guassian residual distribution to determine the variance for all the fitted values.
* GLM was used as the diagnostics were not bormally distributed and did not fit along the line of best fit.

## Test interpretation
* F-statistic : 6.974 on 1
* p-value = 0.01937, therefore reject H0 and accept the alternative hypothesis.
* DF: 14
